The Complete Information Taxonomy for a Trading Bot
1. Market Data (What the Market Is Doing)
1.1 Price Data

OHLCV (multiple timeframes)

Tick / trade prints

VWAP

Mark price

Index price

Settlement price

Failure mode if missing: signals are delayed, distorted, or lagging.

1.2 Order Book / Depth Data

Level 1 (best bid/ask)

Level 2 / DOM

Depth imbalance

Liquidity walls

Microprice

Failure mode: entries/exits are mistimed, slippage explodes.

1.3 Volume & Flow

Aggressive buy vs sell volume

Trade velocity

Absorption / exhaustion

Volume delta

Failure mode: bot trades into traps and fake breakouts.

1.4 Derivatives-Specific Data (if futures/perps)

Funding rates (current, predicted)

Open interest

Basis (spot vs futures)

Liquidation clusters (if available)

Failure mode: bot trades crowded positions at inflection points.

2. Indicator & Feature Information (What the Market Means)
2.1 Technical Indicators

Momentum (RSI, MACD, AO)

Oscillators (Stoch, Williams %R, KDJ)

Trend (EMA, SMA, slope)

Volatility (ATR, Bollinger Bands)

Volume-based (OBV)

Each indicator must expose:

Direction

Strength

Regime sensitivity

Confidence

2.2 Microstructure Features

Bid/ask imbalance

Spread compression/expansion

Flow dominance

Funding skew

Price ratios (mark/index)

Failure mode: bot ignores how price is moving.

2.3 Cross-Timeframe Context

Higher TF bias

Lower TF entry timing

Alignment / conflict states

Failure mode: bot fades strong trends or chases noise.

3. Signal Intelligence (When to Act)
3.1 Signal Construction

Scoring model

Weighting system

Feature aggregation

Thresholds

Direction encoding

3.2 Signal Validity

Staleness windows

Invalidation rules

Regime mismatch checks

Liquidity checks

3.3 Explainability

Feature contributions

Why signal exists

Why signal was rejected

Failure mode: you can’t debug or improve the bot.

4. Execution Information (How to Act)
4.1 Exchange Constraints

Tick size

Lot size

Min/max notional

Leverage limits

Rate limits

4.2 Order Semantics

Order types

Post-only rules

Reduce-only flags

Time-in-force

Cancel/replace behavior

4.3 Execution State

Order lifecycle

Partial fills

Slippage

Fees

Latency

Failure mode: fills don’t match expectations; PnL is wrong.

5. Position Information (What You Hold)

Net position

Average entry

Unrealized PnL

Realized PnL

Liquidation price

Funding paid/received

Failure mode: bot thinks it’s flat when it isn’t.

6. Risk Information (What You Can Afford)
6.1 Account-Level Risk

Account equity

Margin usage

Leverage exposure

Daily loss limits

6.2 Trade-Level Risk

Position sizing inputs

Stop distance

Risk per trade

Max concurrent positions

6.3 Market Risk Filters

Spread thresholds

Volatility spikes

Funding extremes

Illiquidity flags

Failure mode: one bad trade nukes the account.

7. Strategy Configuration (What the Bot Believes)

Indicator parameters

Weights

Thresholds

Timeframes

Symbol universe

Feature toggles

Must be:

Versioned

Validated

Immutable at runtime

8. Learning & Optimization Data (How It Improves)
8.1 Backtest Data

Clean historical data

Survivorship-aware

Corporate action adjusted (if relevant)

8.2 Paper Trading Data

Real-time signals

Simulated fills

Latency & slippage models

8.3 Performance Metrics

Win rate

Expectancy

Drawdown

Sharpe / Sortino

Regime breakdown

9. Feedback Loop (What Actually Happened)

Execution reports

Slippage vs expectation

Fill quality

Exit reason

Trade duration

This is the bridge between research and reality.

10. System Health & Telemetry (Is It Alive?)

WebSocket lag

Disconnects

Reconnects

Missed data

Rate-limit pressure

Clock skew

Failure mode: silent death while you think it’s trading.

11. Persistence & Auditability (Can You Prove It?)

Journals (append-only)

Correlation IDs

Replayability

Deterministic state recovery

Failure mode: impossible post-mortems.

12. Control & Governance (Who Is in Charge)
12.1 Manual Controls

Start/stop

Pause auto

Cancel all

Flatten positions

12.2 Permissions

Who can trade

Who can change configs

Who can deploy

12.3 Safety Systems

Kill switch

Circuit breakers

Emergency shutdown

13. Deployment & Operations (Can It Run Forever?)

Secrets management

Environment separation

Versioning

Rollbacks

Monitoring

Alerting

14. Legal & Compliance (Often Ignored, Still Real)

Exchange TOS compliance

Logging requirements

Data retention

Audit readiness

The One-Sentence Truth

A trading bot is not a strategy — it is an information system that converts market state into risk-constrained decisions under uncertainty.
