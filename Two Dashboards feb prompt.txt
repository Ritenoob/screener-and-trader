Two Dashboards: Recommended Split, Authority, and Data Flow
High-Level Rule (Non-Negotiable)

Dashboard A can move money.
Dashboard B can change ideas.
Neither can do the other.

They may observe each other’s outputs, but authority never overlaps.

Dashboard A — Trader Dashboard

(Execution + Account Authority)

Purpose (Authoritative)

Place / modify / cancel orders

Manage live positions

Run auto trading

Enforce risk & safety

Display exchange truth

This is the only UI allowed to:

Send execution intents

Toggle auto mode

Trigger kill switches

Primary Data Sources (Authoritative Order)

Execution Service (source of truth)

Orders (OMS)

Fills

Positions

Margin / leverage

Risk state

Health & latency

Signal Stream (read-only)

Ranked Signal(v1) objects

Entry/exit intent

Feature breakdown

Signals are suggestions.
Execution state is law.

Core Screens (with Authority Notes)
1. Signal Inbox

Data

Signal(v1): score, confidence, timeframes

Entry/exit plans

Feature contributions

Invalidation rules

Actions

✅ Accept → creates ExecutionIntent

✏️ Modify → constrained overrides (qty, band, SL/TP)

❌ Reject → logged, no execution

Rules

Cannot edit signal logic

Cannot change weights

Cannot rescore

2. Trade Ticket

Controls

Side (locked to signal)

Dashboard B — Signal Generator / Coin Screener

Drawdown

Sharpe / Sortino (from backtest/paper)

5. Paper / Backtest / Optimizer Control

Controls

Parameter sweeps

A/B config comparison

Promotion Flow

Research → Candidate → Approved for live (manual step)

6. Microstructure Telemetry (Live-only)

Panels

DOM imbalance

Trade flow

Funding rate deltas

Mark vs index spread

Flags

Data freshness

Quality degradation warnings

Permissions (Signal Dashboard)

✅ Can:

Modify signal configs

Tune weights

Run research jobs

Promote configs to “live candidate”

❌ Cannot:

Place orders

Modify execution parameters

Control auto mode

Affect OMS/EMS directly

How They Work Together (Strict Contract)
Signal Engine → Execution

Only one thing

Signal(v1)


Sole source of trade opportunities

Immutable once published

Schema-validated

Execution → Signal Engine

Only one thing

ExecutionReport(v1)


Truth about what happened

Accepted / rejected

Fills, PnL, slippage, exit reason

Shared Real-Time Streams
Trader Dashboard subscribes to:

Execution state (authoritative)

Signal stream (read-only)

Signal Dashboard subscribes to:

Signal stream

Screener internals

Execution reports (analytics only)

Authority Matrix (One Glance)
Capability	Trader Dashboard	Signal Dashboard
Place orders	✅	❌
Auto trading	✅	❌
Kill switch	✅	❌
View signals	✅	✅
Edit weights	❌	✅
Run backtests	❌	✅
View execution reports	✅	✅
Exchange access	Indirect	❌
Why This Split Works (For Your System)

Matches your rare, high-conviction signal model

Prevents research tweaks from destabilizing execution

Keeps execution deterministic and auditable

Enables fast iteration on signals without risking capital

Scales cleanly to multiple traders / strategies later

One Sentence to Lock It In

Dashboard A executes reality.
Dashboard B improves ideas.
Signals connect them — reports keep them honest.
