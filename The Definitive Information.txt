The Definitive Information Model for a Trading Bot
(What the system must know, not what it must do)

A trading bot is a decision system under uncertainty.
Every failure comes from missing, stale, or mis-owned information.

LAYER 0 — Reality (The External World)

This layer is never negotiable. It is the ground truth.

0.1 Market Reality

Trades (ticks)

Order book (L1/L2/DOM)

OHLCV (all timeframes)

Mark / Index / Settlement prices

Failure if wrong:
You are trading a fictional market.

0.2 Exchange Reality

Symbol specs (tick size, lot size)

Leverage rules

Margin model

Fee model

Rate limits

Trading halts

Failure if wrong:
Orders reject, fills differ, or positions liquidate unexpectedly.

LAYER 1 — Interpretation (What the Market Means)

This is where raw data becomes signal.

1.1 Structural Features

Trend

Momentum

Volatility

Range vs expansion

Liquidity state

(Indicators live here.)

1.2 Microstructure Features

Bid/ask imbalance

Flow aggression

Spread dynamics

Funding pressure

Basis distortion

Key rule:

Indicators explain where price has been.
Microstructure explains how price is moving now.

Failure if missing:
Bot trades breakouts that never fill or reversals that never revert.

LAYER 2 — Context (When Signals Matter)

Signals without context are noise.

2.1 Time Context

Higher timeframe bias

Lower timeframe entry timing

Alignment / conflict states

2.2 Regime Context

Trending vs ranging

Volatility expansion vs compression

Crowded vs uncrowded

2.3 Market Viability

Liquidity sufficiency

Spread acceptability

Funding sanity

Failure if missing:
Good signals fired at the worst possible moment.

LAYER 3 — Belief (What the Bot Thinks Is True)

This is the “strategy brain”.

3.1 Signal Construction

Feature aggregation

Weighting

Scoring

Direction encoding

Confidence estimation

3.2 Signal Validity

Freshness

Invalidation rules

Dependency checks

Conflicting evidence

3.3 Explainability

Feature contributions

Why long / why short

Why not traded

Failure if weak:
You cannot debug, trust, or improve the system.

LAYER 4 — Intent (What the Bot Wants to Do)

This layer contains no execution. Only intent.

4.1 Trade Intent

Side

Entry logic

Exit logic

Stop logic

Invalidation conditions

4.2 Constraints

Max risk

Timing windows

Required confirmations

Key rule:

Intent must be valid without knowing account state.

LAYER 5 — Risk Reality (What the Bot Is Allowed to Do)

This layer can veto everything above it.

5.1 Account Risk

Equity

Margin usage

Exposure

Daily loss

5.2 Trade Risk

Position size

Stop distance

Risk per trade

Correlation with existing positions

5.3 Market Risk

Spread spikes

Volatility shocks

Funding extremes

Liquidity collapse

Failure if weak:
One trade can destroy months of edge.

LAYER 6 — Execution Reality (What Actually Happens)

This layer is always the final authority.

6.1 Order Lifecycle

Submission

Partial fills

Amendments

Cancels

Rejections

6.2 Fill Quality

Slippage

Latency

Fees

Queue position

Key rule:

Execution truth overrides signal belief.

LAYER 7 — Position Truth (What You Actually Hold)

Net exposure

Average entry

Unrealized PnL

Realized PnL

Liquidation price

Funding paid/received

Failure if wrong:
Bot believes it’s flat while it’s bleeding.

LAYER 8 — Memory (What the Bot Remembers)

This is how systems evolve instead of repeating mistakes.

8.1 Trade History

Entry/exit

Duration

Exit reason

Market state at entry

8.2 Performance Metrics

Expectancy

Drawdown

Regime performance

Symbol performance

8.3 Research Feedback

Signal quality vs execution quality

False positives

Missed opportunities

LAYER 9 — Health & Survival (Is the System Alive?)

WebSocket lag

Data gaps

Reconnect count

Clock drift

Rate-limit pressure

Failure if ignored:
Bot dies silently.

LAYER 10 — Control & Governance (Who Is in Charge)
10.1 Human Overrides

Pause

Resume

Cancel all

Flatten

10.2 Permissions

Who can trade

Who can change configs

Who can deploy

10.3 Safety Systems

Kill switch

Circuit breakers

Emergency shutdown

The Elite Mental Model (Remember This)

Markets generate data.
Signals generate beliefs.
Risk grants permission.
Execution determines truth.
Memory creates edge.
