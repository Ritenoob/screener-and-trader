🏗️ Full Development Plan
Production-Grade Trading Bot (Signal → Execution → Learning)

Objective
Build a deterministic, auditable, multi-indicator + microstructure trading system that safely transitions from research → paper → live trading.

Design Principle

Separate belief, permission, and action.
No layer may bypass the next.

2. Phase-Based Delivery Plan (Authoritative)
🔹 PHASE 0 — Foundations (Week 1)

Goal: Prevent architectural mistakes before code exists.

Deliverables

Stack policy (languages + boundaries)

Interface contracts (Signal v1, ExecutionReport v1)

Repo structure finalized

Configuration schema defined

Correlation ID standard defined

Acceptance Criteria

All teams agree on boundaries

Schemas validated in TS + Rust + Python

No execution code exists yet

🔹 PHASE 1 — Market Data & Signal Layer (Weeks 2–4)

Goal: Produce trustworthy, explainable signals.

Quant Team Tasks

Implement all 10 enhanced indicators

Implement 3 microstructure analyzers (live-only)

Implement TimeframeAligner

Implement SignalGeneratorV2

Implement score clamping logic

Platform Tasks

WebSocketManager (token refresh, reconnects)

Deterministic event ordering

Data staleness detection

Outputs

Signal(v1) stream

Feature breakdown per signal

Coin ranking stream

Acceptance Criteria

Signals are reproducible from replay

No NaNs, no unbounded scores

Every signal is explainable

🔹 PHASE 2 — Research, Backtest & Paper Trading (Weeks 5–6)

Goal: Validate signal quality before touching execution.

Quant Team Tasks

Deterministic backtest engine

PaperTradingEngineV2

Walk-forward validation

Performance metrics (Sharpe, DD, expectancy)

Platform Tasks

Historical data ingestion

Replay harness

Config versioning

Outputs

Backtest reports

Paper trade lifecycle logs

Optimizer outputs

Acceptance Criteria

Backtest == replayed paper logic

Results traceable to config version

No lookahead bias

🔹 PHASE 3 — Execution Core (OMS / EMS) (Weeks 7–9)

Goal: Safe, deterministic execution — no UI yet.

Execution Team Tasks

ExchangeAdapter (KuCoin Futures)

OrderManager (OMS)

ExecutionEngine (EMS)

PositionManager

RiskManager

KillSwitch

Platform Tasks

Reconciliation engine

JournalWriter (append-only)

Restart safety

Outputs

ExecutionReport(v1)

Deterministic journals

Reconcile-on-start

Acceptance Criteria

Restart does not orphan orders

RiskManager blocks unsafe trades

KillSwitch flattens everything

🔹 PHASE 4 — Trader Dashboard (Weeks 10–11)

Goal: Human-in-the-loop execution.

Frontend Tasks

Signal Inbox

Trade Ticket

Blotter

Positions panel

Auto trading controls

Risk & health panel

Backend Tasks

ExecutionIntent API

Permission enforcement

Rate limiting

Acceptance Criteria

Manual trades go through same pipeline as auto

UI cannot bypass risk

Live account truth matches exchange

🔹 PHASE 5 — Signal Dashboard (Weeks 12–13)

Goal: Continuous improvement without execution risk.

Frontend Tasks

Coin screener

Signal monitor

Weights/config editor

Performance analytics

Microstructure telemetry

Quant Tasks

Config promotion workflow

A/B comparison tooling

Acceptance Criteria

Configs are versioned & diffed

No signal edits affect live execution without approval

ExecutionReports feed analytics

🔹 PHASE 6 — Auto Trading Enablement (Week 14)

Goal: Controlled automation.

Tasks

Auto policy layer

Cooldowns

Max concurrency rules

Emergency disable hooks

Acceptance Criteria

Auto ON/OFF is instant

Kill switch always wins

All auto trades auditable

🔹 PHASE 7 — Production Hardening (Weeks 15–16)

Goal: Survive reality.

Tasks

Alerting (PnL, disconnects, lag)

Rate-limit pressure monitoring

Latency tracking

Canary deployments

Acceptance Criteria

Silent failure impossible

Metrics visible in real time

Rollback tested

3. Information Ownership Matrix
Layer	Owner	Can Block Lower Layers
Market Data	Platform	❌
Indicators	Quant	❌
Signals	Quant	❌
Risk	Execution	✅
Execution	Execution	✅
Position	Execution	✅
UI	Frontend	❌
Kill Switch	Execution	✅
4. Non-Negotiable Engineering Rules

No schema, no merge

No risk approval, no order

No journal entry, it didn’t happen

No replayability, not production-ready

Execution truth beats signal belief

5. Definition of “Done” (Real One)

The system is done when:

You can replay any day and get the same decisions

You can explain why every trade happened

You can kill the system in <1 second

You can change signals without risking capital

You trust it enough to sleep

Final Line for the Team

We are not building a strategy.
We are building a decision system that survives uncertainty.
